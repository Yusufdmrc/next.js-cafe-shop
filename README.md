In this project, which I prepared based on Emin Ba≈übayan's Full Stack Food Ordering Project with React (Next.js) course, I used typescript instead of javascript and module css instead of tailwind CSS.

In this project, I learned how to perform backend operations with next js, how to create an admin panel and how to make edits.

I learned router operations with next-router, authentication with next-auth, state management with redux-toolkit, form control with formik, validation with yup, database operations with mongoDb.
